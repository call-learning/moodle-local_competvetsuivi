  Will render the graph header: title and breadcrumb

  Classes required for JS: all the boostrap classes for display

  Data attributes required for JS:

  Context variables required for this template:

  Example context (json):
  {
    "graph_title": the graph title
    "breadcrumb": [ {'name': , 'link'}
    "competency_desc": Competency full description
  }


  Note: we had to make this compatible with lambda theme, so we added spanXX and row-fluid classes
  too (https://redpithemes.com/Documentation/assets/bs_grid.html)
