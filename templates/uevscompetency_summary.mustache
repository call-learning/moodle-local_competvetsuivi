  @local_competvetsuivi

  CompetVetSuivi page template for a single UE showing what the UE contributes
  to the global competency

  Classes required for JS: all the boostrap classes for display

  Data attributes required for JS:

  Context variables required for this template:

  Example context (json):
  {
    "graph_title": the fullname of the current competency,
    "comp_types" : [ 'comp_type_id': numid, 'comp_type_name': fullname ]
    "chartdata": graphdata per strand as an array
                        [
                        { } , ...
                        ]

    ]
  }

  Note: we had to make this compatible with lambda theme, so we added spanXX and row-fluid classes
  too (https://redpithemes.com/Documentation/assets/bs_grid.html)
